## Scenario 6 - Apply rate-limiting to managed API in Kubernetes cluster
- This scenario describes how to apply rate-limiting to a managed API in Kubernetes cluster
- First, we will deploy a rate-limiting custom resource which contains the policy ( 5 requests per minute)
- Then the created rate-limiting policy/CR will be referred in the swagger definition of the API
- Petstore service will be exposed as a managed API with ratelimiting in the Kubernetes cluster 
- Finally, we will invoke the API continuously and observe the throttling behavior.

 ***Important:***
> Follow the main README and deploy the apim-operator and configuration files. Make sure to set the analyticsEnabled to "true" and deploy analytics secret with credentials to analytics server and certificate, if you want to check analytics.


 ##### Deploying the sample backendservice
 
 - Navigate to wso2am-k8s-crds-1.0.0/scenarios/scenario-6 directory.
  
 - Deploy the sample rate-limiting CR using the following command.
    ```
        apicli apply -f advance5.yaml
    ```
    - Output:
    ```
        ratelimiting.wso2.com/advance5 created
    ```

- Prepared petstore basic swagger definition can be found within this directory.
- Rate limiting policies to be applied on the API, should be mentioned in the swagger file with the "x-wso2-throttling-tier" extension.
In this swagger definition, the rate limiting policy has been mentioned as follows.
    ```
        x-wso2-throttling-tier: advance5
    ```
- Execute the following to expose pet-store as an API.

- Create API <br /> 
    ```
        apictl add api -n petstore-rate --from-file=swagger.yaml
    ``` 
    - Output:
    ```
        creating configmap with swagger definition
        configmap/petstore-rate-swagger created
        api.wso2.com/petstore-rate created
    ```
    
- Get available API <br /> 
    ```
        apictl get apis
    ```
    - Output:
    ```    
        NAME          AGE
        petstore-rate   5m
    ```

- Get service details to invoke the API. (Please wait until the external-IP is populated in the corresponding service)
    ```
        apictl get services
    ```
    - Output:
    
    ```
        NAME            TYPE           CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP       PORT(S)                         AGE
        petstore-rate   LoadBalancer   10.83.4.44   104.197.114.248   9095:30680/TCP,9090:30540/TCP   8m20s
    ```
    - You can see petstore service has been exposed as a managed API.
    - Get the external IP of the managed API's service
 
- Invoking the API <br />

    ```
   
    ```
        curl -X GET "https://<external IP of LB service>:9095/petstore/v1/pet/55" -H "accept: application/xml" -H "Authorization:Bearer $TOKEN" -k
    ```
    - Once you execute the above command, it will call to the managed API (petstore-rate), which then call its endpoint(https://petstore.swagger.io/v2). If the request is success, you would be able to see the response as below.
    ```
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?><Pet><category><id>55</id><name>string</name></category><id>55</id><name>SRC_TIME_SIZE</name><photoUrls><photoUrl>string</photoUrl></photoUrls><status>available</status><tags><tag><id>55</id><name>string</name></tag></tags></Pet>
    ```
    - Continue to call the API with above curl for more than 5 times. After 5th time, you will get the following error message saying that the request has been throttled out.
    ```$xslt
        {"fault":{"code":900802, "message":"Message throttled out", "description":"You have exceeded your quota"}}
    ```

- Delete the  API <br /> 
    - Following command will delete all the artifacts created with this API including pods, deployment and services.
    ```
        apictl delete api petstore-rate
    ```
    -  Output:
    ```
        api.wso2.com "petstore-rate" deleted
    ```
